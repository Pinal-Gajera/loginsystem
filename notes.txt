password is in plain text in database,
  should it safe?? or not and why??
---> in our database we have password in plain text if somone stole our database they can get our user's account and they can stole thier information so
     the soution is password hashing. by this we store password's hash value insted of password and in code we match both password's hash value. 
     and for that we need password in code to convert into hash.
---> In php we have funtion password_hash() and password_verify()
     password_hash(,password_default)=> 255 character is good.     
---> password_verify(#[\SensitiveParameter] string $password, string $hash): bool
     password_verify â€” Verifies that a password matches a hash
